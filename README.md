# kitchen_diary

Hi everyone, this is the project i have developed to monitor our own kitchen and room expenses.
Currently we five utilizing this app/website. In our earlier days we used notebook to write the daily expenses.
We felt it's quite hard to calculate all the things in the end of the month. After this big task we came to know our room rent amount.
But now we switched into software side. This app did all the things like listing the day to day purchase, overall purchase, individual contribution, rent allocation(only for incharge of the month) etc.

Technologies used to create this project, For front-end design: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap
Scripting: PHP, Javascript, Jquery, Ajax. Back-end: MySQL.
And finally this is converted into an APK. 

Thanks for reading this.
Regards,
Balakrishnan S
